This application will allow users to log in and enter data for their favorite movie. From here, using the OMDB API, I will get the plot of that movie along with some other information.  Each user than has the ability to turn the plot into yodish (of the way Yoda speaks).  They are than able to rate the plot, make a favorite collection of the ones they like, upload poster/movie images to the app, among other interesting features.  While there are already apps for getting movie data, I wanted to make a fun twist on it. Being a huge Star Wars fan, I thought it would be fun to see how Yoda would descirbe the movie plots.
